WORKING WITH LISTS IN PYTHON
Length of a List
Often, we’ll need to find the number of items in a list, usually called its length.

We can do this using the function len. When we apply len to a list, we get the number of elements in that list:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(len(my_list))
This would yield:

5
Instructions
1.
Calculate the length of list1 and save it to the variable list1_len.

2.
Use print to examine list1_len.

3.
Change the range command that generates list1 so that it skips 3 instead of 2 between items.

How does this change list1_len?
