WORKING WITH LISTS IN PYTHON
Review
In this lesson, we learned how to:

Get the length of a list
Select subsets of a list (called slicing)
Count the number of times that an element appears in a list
Sort a list of items
Instructions
1.
inventory is a list of items that are in the warehouse for Bob’s Furniture. How many items are in the warehouse?

Save your answer to inventory_len.


Hint
Use len to find the number of items in inventory

2.
Select the first element in inventory. Save it to the variable first.


Hint
If we wanted to select the second element in inventory, we would use:

second = inventory[1]
Remember that Python lists are zero-indexed.

3.
Select the last item from inventory and save it to the variable last.


Hint
The last item has index -1.

4.
Select items from the inventory starting at index 2 and up to, but not including, index 6.

Save your answer to inventory_2_6.


Hint
If we wanted to select items from the inventory starting at index 5 and up to, but not including, index 7, we would use:

inventory_5_7 = inventory[5:7]
5.
Select the first 3 items of inventory and save it to the variable first_3.


Hint
If we wanted to select the first 5 items from inventory, we would use:

inventory[:5]
6.
How many 'twin bed's are in inventory? Save your answer to twin_beds.


Hint
If we wanted to know how many 'dresser's were in inventory, we would use:

num_dressers = inventory.count('dresser')
7.
Sort inventory using .sort().

Concept Review
Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a look at this material's cheatsheet!

problem 

inventory = ['twin bed', 'twin bed', 'headboard', 'queen bed', 'king bed', 'dresser', 'dresser', 'table', 'table', 'nightstand', 'nightstand', 'king bed', 'king bed', 'twin bed', 'twin bed', 'sheets', 'sheets', 'pillow', 'pillow']

solution 

inventory = ['twin bed', 'twin bed', 'headboard', 'queen bed', 'king bed', 'dresser', 'dresser', 'table', 'table', 'nightstand', 'nightstand', 'king bed', 'king bed', 'twin bed', 'twin bed', 'sheets', 'sheets', 'pillow', 'pillow']

inventory_len = len(inventory)
first = inventory[0]
last = inventory[-1]
inventory_2_6 = inventory[2:6]
first_3 = inventory[:3]
twin_beds = inventory.count('twin bed')
inventory.sort()
