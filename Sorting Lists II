WORKING WITH LISTS IN PYTHON
Sorting Lists II
A second way of sorting a list is to use sorted. sorted is different from .sort() in several ways:

It comes before a list, instead of after.
It generates a new list.
Let’s return to our list of names:

names = ['Xander', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Willow', 'Giles']
Using sorted, we can create a new list, called sorted_names:

sorted_names = sorted(names)
print(sorted_names)
This yields the list sorted alphabetically:

['Angel', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander']
Note that using sorted did not change names:

>>> print(names)
['Xander', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Willow', 'Giles']
Instructions
1.
Use sorted to order games and create a new list called games_sorted.

2.
Use print to inspect games and games_sorted. How are they different?
