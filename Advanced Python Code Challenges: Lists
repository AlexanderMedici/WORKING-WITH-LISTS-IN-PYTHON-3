Advanced Python Code Challenges: Lists
Difficult Python Code Challenges involving Lists

This article will help you review Python functions by providing some code challenges involving lists.

Some of these challenges are difficult! Take some time to think about them before starting to code.

You might not get the solution correct on your first try — look at your output, try to find where you’re going wrong, and iterate on your solution.

Finally, if you get stuck, use our solution code! If you “Check Answer” twice with an incorrect solution, you should see an option to get our solution code. However, truly investigate that solution — experiment and play with the solution code until you have a good grasp of how it is working. Good luck!

Function Syntax
As a refresher, function syntax looks like this:

def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):
  # … do something with the inputs …
  return output
For example, a function that returns the sum of the first and last elements of a given list might look like this:

def first_plus_last(lst):
  return lst[0] + lst[-1]
And this would produce output like:

>>> first_plus_last([1, 2, 3, 4])
5
>>> first_plus_last([8, 2, 5, -8])
0
>>> first_plus_last([-10, 2, 3, -4])
-14
Challenges
We’ve included 5 list challenges below. Try to answer all of them and polish up your problem-solving skills and your list expertise!

1. Every Three Numbers
Create a function called every_three_nums that has one parameter named start.

The function should return a list of every third number between start and 100 (inclusive). For example, every_three_nums(91) should return the list [91, 94, 97, 100]. If start is greater than 100, the function should return an empty list.

#Write your function here


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(every_three_nums(91))
Output:
 
2. Remove Middle
Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named lst, start, and end.

The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.

For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:

remove_middle([4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3)

#Write your function here


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))
Output:
 
3. More Frequent Item
Create a function named more_frequent_item that has three parameters named lst, item1, and item2.

Return either item1 or item2 depending on which item appears more often in lst.

If the two items appear the same number of times, return item1.

#Write your function here

#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(more_frequent_item([2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3))
Output:
 
4. Double Index
Create a function named double_index that has two parameters: a list named lst and a single number named index.

The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except for the element at index. The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original lst.

If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.

For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:

double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
After writing your function, un-comment the call to the function that we’ve provided for you to test your results.

#Write your function here


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(double_index([3, 8, -10, 12], 2))
Output:
 
5. Middle Item
Create a function called middle_element that has one parameter named lst.

If there are an odd number of elements in lst, the function should return the middle element. If there are an even number of elements, the function should return the average of the middle two elements

#Write your function here


#Uncomment the line below when your function is done
#print(middle_element([5, 2, -10, -4, 4, 5]))
