WORKING WITH LISTS IN PYTHON
Selecting List Elements II
What if we want to select the last element of a list?

We can use the index -1 to select the last item of a list, even when we don’t know how many elements are in a list.

Consider the following list with 5 elements:

list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
If we select the -1 element, we get the final element, 'e':

>>> print(list1[-1])
'e'
This is the same as selecting the element with index 4:

>>> print(list1[4])
'e'
Instructions
1.
Use print and len to display the length of shopping_list.

2.
Get the last element of shopping_list using the -1 index. Save this element to the variable last_element.

3.
Now select the element with index 5 and save it to the variable element5.

4.
Use print to display both element5 and last_element.
